## 🏁 Start Here — What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw (formerly **Clawdbot**, briefly **Moltbot**) is an open-source, **local-first autonomous AI agent framework**. You run a persistent process called the **Gateway** on hardware you control — a Mac mini, a VPS, a Raspberry Pi — and it connects to messaging apps you already use. When you send a message, OpenClaw runs an agent turn powered by an LLM, invokes tools or skills, and responds — often taking real actions on your behalf.

**Key design decisions that explain the hype:**

- **Messaging app as UI** — No new app to install. WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, iMessage — whatever you already live in becomes your agent interface.
- **Local-first, self-hosted** — Your data stays on your machine. No third-party server sees your context.
- **Skills/Plugins architecture** — Capabilities are tiny markdown-declared plugins. Anyone can write one in under an hour.
- **Persistent memory** — Flat-file Markdown memory (`MEMORY.md`, `SOUL.md`) persists across restarts without a vector database.
- **Model-agnostic** — Works with Claude, GPT-5, Gemini, local Ollama models, and OpenRouter.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

Five concepts unlock the entire ecosystem:

### 1. The Gateway
A WebSocket server (port 18789) that is the single orchestration point. It normalizes heterogeneous messaging protocols — WhatsApp via Baileys, Telegram via grammY, Slack Events API, Discord gateway — into a canonical internal message format. No intelligence lives here. It is a pure traffic controller.

### 2. Skills vs Plugins vs MCP

| | Skills | Plugins | MCP Integrations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Format** | `SKILL.md` markdown | TypeScript npm package | Separate process, any language |
| **Complexity** | Zero-code | Full code + lifecycle hooks | Full code + separate runtime |
| **Distribution** | ClawHub registry | npm / GitHub | Any URL or local |
| **Isolation** | None (in-process) | Application-level | Process-level |
| **Best for** | Quick capabilities, integrations | Deep system access, custom providers | External service integrations |
| **Example** | Gmail skill, Notion skill | ClawRouter, SecureClaw | Playwright MCP, GitHub MCP |

### 3. Memory Architecture
OpenClaw uses **filesystem-as-truth** memory — no vector database required by default.

| File | Purpose | Mutable by Agent? |
|---|---|---|
| `MEMORY.md` | Long-term distilled facts | ✅ Yes |
| `SOUL.md` | Core identity and values | ✅ Yes (unless locked) |
| `AGENTS.md` | Immutable operating instructions | ❌ No — agent cannot touch this |
| `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Daily episodic logs | ✅ Auto-appended |

### 4. Context Engineering
When approaching token limits, OpenClaw triggers **session compaction** — summarizing oldest turns while preserving tool call-result pairs. Sessions reset at configurable boundaries (default: 4 AM UTC). Result: effectively unlimited conversation length.

### 5. Channel Isolation
Each connected messaging platform is a **channel** with its own context namespace. Skills can be scoped per channel using `channels:` in the skill manifest. Run 10+ channels simultaneously with per-channel permission sets.

## 🤖 LLM Model Selection Guide

> This is one of the most common questions new users ask, and no other resource covers it well. Here is the community consensus as of March 2026.

### Model Comparison at a Glance

| Model | Provider | Strength | Weakness | Best OpenClaw Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Sonnet 4** | Anthropic | Best tool-calling reliability; nuanced instruction following | Higher cost than Gemini | Default recommendation; daily driver for most users |
| **Claude Haiku 4** | Anthropic | Very fast, cheap | Less capable for complex multi-step tasks | High-volume triage, simple automations, notifications |
| **GPT-5** | OpenAI | Strong reasoning, very capable coding | Cost; sometimes over-verbose in tool calls | Complex coding tasks, analytical workflows |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | Google | Longest context window (1M tokens); best price at scale | Tool call formatting occasionally inconsistent | Document-heavy workflows, research, long sessions |
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash** | Google | Fastest response, cheapest capable model | Less reliable on complex tool chains | Real-time automations, cost-sensitive deployments |
| **Llama 4 Scout** (Ollama) | Meta / Local | Free, fully private, no API key needed | Needs capable hardware (16GB+ VRAM recommended) | Air-gapped environments, privacy-critical data |
| **Qwen3-32B** (Ollama) | Alibaba / Local | Strong multilingual; excellent for non-English workloads | Hardware requirements | Multilingual deployments |
| **OpenRouter** | Multi | Automatic routing, unified billing, fallback logic | Adds latency, another dependency | Teams wanting flexibility; ClawRouter power users |

### Recommendation by Use Case

**Personal productivity agent (email, calendar, tasks):**
→ **Claude Sonnet 4** as primary. **Claude Haiku 4** for simple reminders and quick lookups. Route with ClawRouter.

**Software development assistant:**
→ **GPT-5** or **Claude Sonnet 4**. Both excel at code. GPT-5 slightly stronger on large refactors; Sonnet 4 more reliable on multi-step tool chains.

**Research and document processing:**
→ **Gemini 2.5 Pro** for its 1M token context window. Process entire codebases or large PDFs without chunking.

**Privacy-first / air-gapped deployment:**
→ **Llama 4 Scout** (16GB VRAM) or **Qwen3-14B** (8GB VRAM) via Ollama. No data leaves your machine.

**Cost-optimized high-volume:**
→ **Gemini 2.5 Flash** or **Claude Haiku 4**. Use ClawRouter to auto-route cheap tasks to these and expensive tasks to Sonnet/GPT-5.

### Configuring Multiple Models

```bash
# Configure a primary and fallback model
openclaw config set model.primary "Claude Sonnet 4.6"
openclaw config set model.fallback "gemini-2.5-flash"
openclaw config set model.coding "gpt-5"

# Or use OpenRouter for automatic routing
openclaw config set provider "openrouter"
openclaw config set model.primary "openrouter/auto"
```

### Local Model Setup with Ollama

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull a recommended model
ollama pull llama4:scout        # 16GB VRAM
ollama pull qwen3:14b           # 8GB VRAM
ollama pull mistral-nemo:12b    # 6GB VRAM (minimum viable)

# Point OpenClaw at local Ollama
openclaw config set provider "ollama"
openclaw config set model.primary "llama4:scout"
```

## 💰 Cost Estimation Guide

> One of the top reasons people hesitate to try OpenClaw. Here are real numbers.

### API Cost by Provider (March 2026 Pricing)

| Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Output (per 1M tokens) | Typical turn cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Sonnet 4 | $3.00 | $15.00 | ~$0.005–0.02 |
| Claude Haiku 4 | $0.80 | $4.00 | ~$0.001–0.005 |
| GPT-5 | $10.00 | $30.00 | ~$0.01–0.05 |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro | $1.25 | $5.00 | ~$0.003–0.015 |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.15 | $0.60 | ~$0.0003–0.002 |
| Llama 4 / Ollama | $0 | $0 | Hardware cost only |

> *"Typical turn cost"* = one user message + agent response, including tool calls. Complex multi-step tasks cost more.

### Monthly Cost Estimates by Usage Profile

| Profile | Description | Est. Monthly API Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **Light** | ~50 messages/day, mostly simple tasks | $3–8/month |
| **Moderate** | ~200 messages/day, mix of simple and complex | $15–40/month |
| **Heavy** | ~500 messages/day, complex workflows with many tool calls | $50–150/month |
| **Team (5 people)** | Shared instance, ~1000 messages/day | $100–300/month |
| **Enterprise** | Custom; ClawTeam managed billing | Contact vendors |

> **Actual costs vary dramatically** based on model choice, skill complexity, and conversation length. The `cost-tracker` skill gives you real per-conversation data.

### Cost Optimization Strategies

**1. Use ClawRouter for intelligent routing (40–60% savings)**
```bash
openclaw skill install BlockRunAI/clawrouter
# Routes simple tasks (reminders, lookups) to Haiku/Flash
# Routes complex tasks (code, research) to Sonnet/GPT-5
# Users report 40-60% cost reduction
```

**2. Context window hygiene**
```bash
# Enable aggressive session compaction
openclaw config set context.compaction_threshold 0.7
openclaw config set context.reset_schedule "0 4 * * *"  # 4am UTC daily
```

**3. Scope skills narrowly**
Skills with broad triggers (`use this when the user asks anything about...`) consume more tokens evaluating whether to activate. Narrow trigger conditions = fewer wasted tokens.

**4. Use local models for bulk tasks**
Run Ollama locally for high-volume, lower-complexity tasks (email sorting, routine summaries). Zero marginal API cost.

### Total Cost of Ownership: Self-Hosted vs Managed

| | Self-Hosted VPS | Managed (ClawHost) | Self-Hosted Homelab |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Infrastructure** | $5–18/month (Hetzner/DO) | $10–30/month | ~$0/month (existing hardware) |
| **Setup time** | 30–120 min | 5–15 min | 2–4 hours |
| **Maintenance** | 1–2 hrs/month | None | 1–2 hrs/month |
| **Privacy** | High | Medium | Maximum |
| **Reliability** | High (99.9% SLA typical) | High | Depends on hardware |
| **Best for** | Most users | Beginners, busy professionals | Power users, homelabbers |

## 🏢 Enterprise Deployment

> For teams and organizations with compliance, multi-tenancy, and governance requirements.

### Authentication & Access Control

**Single Sign-On (SSO):**
```bash
# SAML 2.0 via Nginx auth_request
# OpenClaw itself is auth-agnostic; put auth in your reverse proxy layer
# Community guide: https://docs.openclaw.ai/enterprise/sso
```

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| [agent-access-control skill](https://clawhub.ai/community/agent-access-control) | Tiered access control — restrict which users trigger which actions |

### Multi-Tenancy Patterns

OpenClaw does not have native multi-tenancy. Enterprise teams use one of three patterns:

**Pattern A — One instance per team/user (Recommended)**
```
User A → Gateway A (port 18789) → Memory A
User B → Gateway B (port 18790) → Memory B
```
Complete isolation. Simple. Works with Ansible or Docker Compose per user.

**Pattern B — Shared instance, per-channel isolation**
One Gateway, multiple channels, channel-scoped skills and permissions. Lower cost; shared memory is a risk.

**Pattern C — ClawTeam managed multi-tenancy**
ClawTeam handles auth, routing, and billing. Best for teams >10 people who don't want to manage infra.

### Compliance & Auditing

| Tool | Description | Standard |
|---|---|---|
| [agent-audit-trail](https://clawhub.ai/community/agent-audit-trail) | Tamper-evident hash-chained action logs | SOC 2 Type II compatible |
| [SecureClaw](https://github.com/adversa-ai/secureclaw) | 55-point security audit; OWASP ASI + MITRE ATLAS mappings | OWASP ASI Top 10 |
| [NemoClaw](https://github.com/nvidia/nemoclaw) | NVIDIA-sandboxed build; GPU-accelerated, fully isolated | Air-gap ready |

### Data Residency

By default, your data goes to your chosen LLM provider's API. For organizations with data residency requirements:

- **EU:** Use Anthropic EU endpoints or Gemini EU-hosted endpoints; deploy OpenClaw on Hetzner Germany
- **Air-gap:** Run Ollama locally — zero data leaves your network. See [Ollama × OpenClaw Integration Guide](https://docs.ollama.com/integrations/openclaw)
- **On-premise:** NemoClaw for fully isolated deployments with local GPU inference

### Disaster Recovery

```bash
# Backup your entire OpenClaw state
tar -czf openclaw-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz \
  ~/openclaw-data/memory \
  ~/openclaw-data/skills \
  ~/.openclaw/config.json

# Restore
tar -xzf openclaw-backup-20260315.tar.gz -C ~/openclaw-data/
```

The `cron-backup` skill automates this on a schedule and optionally uploads to S3, Backblaze B2, or any S3-compatible provider.

## 🧠 Memory & Knowledge Systems

### Built-in Memory Files

| File | Purpose | Mutable by Agent |
|---|---|---|
| `MEMORY.md` | Long-term distilled facts and preferences | ✅ |
| `SOUL.md` | Core identity, values, operating instructions | ✅ (lock recommended) |
| `AGENTS.md` | Immutable rules — agent cannot override | ❌ |
| `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Daily episodic logs | ✅ Auto-appended |

### External Memory Integrations

| Tool | Description | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| [Supermemory](https://supermemory.ai) | Managed external memory with semantic search | Teams needing shared memory across instances |
| [Graphiti](https://github.com/getzep/graphiti) | Temporal knowledge graph memory | Complex relational knowledge over time |
| [MemOS](https://github.com/MemTensor/MemOS) | Hierarchical memory OS for LLM agents | Research-grade memory architecture |
| [mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) | Self-improving personalized memory | Personalization-heavy workflows |

### Memory Best Practices

1. **Keep `SOUL.md` short and opinionated.** 200–300 words. Specific beats generic.
2. **Use `AGENTS.md` for non-negotiable rules.** Security policies, content restrictions, tool limits — the agent cannot override it.
3. **Prune `MEMORY.md` monthly.** Old facts accumulate. Review and remove stale entries.
4. **Separate work and personal contexts** using channel-scoped memory with different channel configurations.
5. **Never put credentials in memory files.** Use environment variables or the secrets manager.

## 🔒 Security

> This section exists because no other Awesome OpenClaw list treats security seriously enough. OpenClaw runs with broad system access. Security is not optional.

### Known CVEs & Incidents

| CVE / Incident | Severity | Description | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CVE-2026-25253** | 🔴 Critical | WebSocket RCE — unauthenticated remote code execution if gateway exposed to internet | Update to v1.8.4+. Never expose port 18789 directly. |
| **ClawHub Malicious Skills (Jan 2026)** | 🔴 High | 341 malicious skills; some exfiltrated data via Base64-chunked requests to unknown endpoints. 26% of popular skills had at least one high-severity vector (Cisco research) | Use SecureClaw + `skill-guard` before installing any skill |
| **41K+ Exposed Instances (Feb 2026)** | 🔴 High | 41,600 OpenClaw gateways publicly exposed; 2,100+ leaking API keys | Audit firewall rules. Use the SecureClaw network audit. |
| **Prompt Injection via Skill Descriptions** | 🟠 Medium | Malicious skills embed hidden instructions overriding user intent | SecureClaw behavioral rules; review skill source |
| **API Key in Memory Logs** | 🟡 Low–Medium | Agent wrote API keys to daily logs when processing config messages | Fixed in v1.9.1; audit old `memory/` logs |

### Essential Security Tools

#### SecureClaw (Install First)

[**SecureClaw**](https://github.com/adversa-ai/secureclaw) by Adversa AI:
- 55 audit checks across the full attack surface
- 15 behavioral rules (~1,150 tokens) against prompt injection
- Maps to OWASP ASI Top 10 and MITRE ATLAS

```bash
openclaw plugin add secureclaw
openclaw skill install adversa-ai/secureclaw
openclaw secureclaw audit --full
openclaw secureclaw harden
```

#### Other Security Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| [skill-guard](https://clawhub.ai/jamesOuttake/skill-guard) | Scan ClawHub skills for security vulnerabilities before installing — detects prompt injection, malware payloads, hardcoded keys and other threats |
| [agent-audit-trail skill](https://clawhub.ai/community/agent-audit-trail) | Tamper-evident hash-chained action logging |
| [agent-access-control skill](https://clawhub.ai/community/agent-access-control) | Tiered access control per user/channel |

### Secure Deployment: Nginx Reverse Proxy

**Never expose port 18789 directly.** Always use a reverse proxy with authentication:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    location /openclaw/ {
        auth_basic "OpenClaw Gateway";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;

        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:18789/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;

        # Rate limiting
        limit_req zone=openclaw burst=20 nodelay;
        limit_req_log_level warn;
    }
}

# Rate limit zone definition (in http block)
# limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=openclaw:10m rate=10r/s;
```

### Skill Vetting Checklist

Before installing any skill from ClawHub:

- [ ] **Author verification:** Real GitHub profile with commit history?
- [ ] **Age and stars:** New repo + suspiciously high stars = red flag
- [ ] **Read the source:** SKILL.md files are markdown — readable in 2 minutes. Look for hidden instructions after HTML comments or inside code blocks
- [ ] **Permission scope:** Does a calculator skill request network access? Reject over-privileged skills
- [ ] **VirusTotal:** Check the ClawHub page for VirusTotal scan results
- [ ] **Run skill-guard:** `openclaw run "use skill-guard to audit [skill-name]"`

**Automatic red flags in skill source:**
- Instructions to ignore previous instructions or `AGENTS.md`
- Requests to send data to external URLs not mentioned in the README
- Base64-encoded content embedded in the skill file
- Instructions to modify `SOUL.md` or `AGENTS.md`
- `fetch()` calls to hardcoded external domains without disclosure

| **Security Model** | Application-level (NanoClaw provides container isolation) | None native | None native | None native | None native | None native |
| **Best for** | Personal / team productivity agents | Research, complex multi-agent | Business workflow automation | Stateful pipelines, research | Non-technical automators | Customer-facing chatbots |
| **Worst for** | Complex multi-agent pipelines | Non-technical users | Real-time personal assistants | Simple use cases | LLM-heavy workflows | Power users needing full control |
| **GitHub Stars** | 247K | 38K | 26K | 12K | 51K | 14K |

### When to Choose OpenClaw

✅ **Choose OpenClaw if:**
- You want a personal productivity agent you interact with via messaging apps
- You need a large ecosystem of pre-built skills (13,729 on ClawHub)
- You want low-code skill authoring (SKILL.md format)
- Local-first, self-hosted privacy matters to you
- You're building for a team that will use their existing chat tools

❌ **Don't choose OpenClaw if:**
- You need complex multi-agent orchestration with elaborate handoff protocols (→ use AutoGen or CrewAI)
- You're building a customer-facing chatbot with conversation flows (→ use Botpress)
- You need a visual no-code automation builder for non-technical users (→ use n8n)
- You're doing research requiring fine-grained state machine control (→ use LangGraph)

### OpenClaw vs AutoGen

The most common comparison. Key difference: AutoGen is designed for **multi-agent systems** where agents collaborate in code. OpenClaw is designed for **single-agent productivity** with a rich skill ecosystem. If you want an AI assistant that takes actions on your behalf via chat, OpenClaw wins. If you want agents collaborating to solve complex research problems, AutoGen wins.

### OpenClaw vs n8n

n8n is a visual workflow automation tool for non-technical users. OpenClaw is a conversational agent for power users. They're complementary: many users run n8n for scheduled workflows and OpenClaw for on-demand conversational tasks. The `n8n-webhook` skill bridges the two.

## ❓ FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Installation & Setup

**Q: What are the minimum hardware requirements?**
A: Node.js 20+ for OpenClaw core. Minimum 1GB RAM (2GB recommended for comfortable operation with several skills). Any modern 64-bit OS. For local models via Ollama: 8GB VRAM minimum; 16GB recommended.

**Q: What's the difference between `openclaw onboard` and `openclaw start`?**
A: `onboard` is a one-time interactive wizard that sets up your config, connects your first channel, and installs essential skills. `start` just starts the gateway with existing config. Always run `onboard` first.

**Q: Do I need a paid API key to get started?**
A: No. You can run fully locally using Ollama + an open-source model (Llama 4, Qwen3). The experience is less capable but costs nothing. Most users start with a Claude or OpenAI API key for the best out-of-the-box quality.

---

### Gateway & Connection Issues

**Q: Gateway starts but I can't connect from my messaging app.**
A: Check these in order:
1. Confirm port 18789 is not blocked: `curl http://localhost:18789/health`
2. If using Docker, ensure you're binding correctly: `127.0.0.1:18789:18789` (not `0.0.0.0`)
3. If accessing remotely, confirm your reverse proxy is correctly configured
4. Check logs: `openclaw logs --tail 50`

**Q: WhatsApp keeps disconnecting every few hours.**
A: This is a Baileys (WhatsApp Web library) limitation. Solutions:
- Keep the QR-scanned device active and connected to the internet
- Configure auto-reconnect rules in `AGENTS.md`, or use a deployment script with watchdog support
- Consider switching to Telegram as your primary channel — it's more stable for server deployments

**Q: My Telegram bot stopped responding.**
A: 99% of the time this is a bot token issue or a conflicting webhook. Check:
```bash
openclaw channel status telegram
openclaw channel reconnect telegram
```

---

### Performance & Memory

**Q: OpenClaw is using 2GB+ of RAM. Is that normal?**
A: With the full skill ecosystem loaded, yes. Mitigation strategies:
- Use `openclaw skill list --active` to audit which skills are loaded
- Uninstall skills you don't use: `openclaw skill remove [name]`
- Consider ZeroClaw (7.8MB RAM) if resource efficiency is critical

**Q: Responses are getting slower over long conversations.**
A: Context window is filling up. Solutions:
- Enable aggressive compaction: `openclaw config set context.compaction_threshold 0.7`
- Schedule daily resets: `openclaw config set context.reset_schedule "0 4 * * *"`
- Configure health checks and auto-restart in your `docker-compose.yml`

**Q: Memory is growing unboundedly. `MEMORY.md` is now 50,000 words.**
A: The agent will write memories indefinitely if not pruned. Best practices:
- Set a monthly calendar reminder to review and prune `MEMORY.md`
- Use the `memory-manager` skill to auto-summarize and compress old entries
- Hard limit: Add to `AGENTS.md`: "Keep MEMORY.md under 10,000 words. Summarize and compress when approaching that limit."

---

### Skills & Security

**Q: I installed a skill and now my agent is behaving strangely.**
A: Likely prompt injection via a malicious or poorly written skill. Steps:
1. Disable the skill: `openclaw skill disable [name]`
2. Review its source code for hidden instructions
3. Run `openclaw secureclaw audit --full`
4. Report to ClawHub if it's genuinely malicious

**Q: How do I prevent a skill from accessing the internet?**
A: Add to `AGENTS.md`:
```
[skill-name] must never make external network requests except to [approved-domain].
```
For stronger enforcement, use agent-access-control skill or switch to NanoClaw which offers container-level isolation.

**Q: My API key was accidentally written to a memory log. What do I do?**
1. Immediately rotate the key at your provider's console
2. Delete the affected log: `rm ~/openclaw-data/memory/[date].md`
3. Run `openclaw secureclaw audit` to check for other exposures
4. Add to `AGENTS.md`: "Never write, log, or repeat API keys, tokens, or credentials under any circumstances."

### Costs & Models

**Q: My API costs are much higher than expected.**
A: Common causes:
1. Skills with very broad trigger conditions → audit with `cost-tracker` skill
2. No session compaction → conversations accumulate context indefinitely
3. Wrong model for the task → use ClawRouter to route cheap tasks to cheap models
4. Context window leaks from a poorly written skill loading large documents

**Q: Can I set a monthly spending cap?**
A: Not natively in OpenClaw core, but:
- The `cost-tracker` skill sends alerts when you hit thresholds
- Set hard limits directly at your API provider (Anthropic, OpenAI all support this)
- ClawRouter can be configured to stop routing to expensive models after a cost limit

### Updates & Migrations

**Q: How do I safely update OpenClaw?**
```bash
# Backup first
tar -czf ~/openclaw-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz ~/openclaw-data/

# Update
npm update -g openclaw

# Verify
openclaw --version
openclaw health check
```

**Q: How do I migrate from OpenClaw to ZeroClaw?**
ZeroClaw supports direct config import:
```bash
zeroclaw migrate --from ~/.openclaw
# Memory and config files are compatible; most skills work via MCP bridge
```
